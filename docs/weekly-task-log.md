# Weekly Task Log

This file documents what Group 54 was asked to build each week, how the work is organized, and how member contributions should be tracked.

## Week 1 - SafeX AI/ML Prototype

### Original Task

Build a small AI/ML prototype for SafeX, for example:

- FAQ chatbot for safexsolutions.com or SafeX-related information.
- Social-media engagement forecast model.
- Data dashboard using real or sample data.

Also document the approach and results as a portfolio case study.

Group leader responsibility:

- consolidate the group's weekly submissions
- send a short summary to the Team Lead by Friday
- submit anonymous feedback on the Team Lead / overall program through the feedback form

### Group Direction

Group 54 selected the FAQ chatbot prototype.

### What Was Built

The Week 1 workspace contains a local SafeX FAQ chatbot with:

- FAQ data in JSON format
- text similarity matching
- chatbot response logic
- Streamlit interface
- evaluation scripts and tests
- portfolio case-study documentation

### How It Was Built

Primary approach:

- Store FAQ content in `week1/data/faq.json`.
- Load and normalize FAQ entries through the knowledge base layer.
- Use vector similarity to match user questions with the closest FAQ answer.
- Render the chatbot through Streamlit.
- Validate expected responses through tests and evaluation questions.

## Week 2 - Business Automation Research

### Original Task

Each member designs, builds, and documents one component of the Business Automation Research project. Each module should continue the group's Week 1 work and integrate cleanly with the other modules.

Common deliverables:

- Jupyter notebook or script with sample input/output.
- Source code or working files for the assigned module.
- Short written documentation explaining what was built, how it works, and how to run or view it.
- Screenshots or a short recording of the module working.
- GitHub repository updates.
- Final working demo.
- Progress report.
- Mandatory explanation video, 5-15 minutes, HD, face visible, covering architecture, challenges, tools used, and working demo.

Common technologies:

- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- NLP libraries such as spaCy or NLTK, or an LLM API
- Flask or FastAPI where applicable
- Streamlit for local module demos
- WhatsApp Business API or Twilio where applicable

### Group Direction

Group 54 organized Week 2 as a modular business automation suite under `week2/`.

The shared Streamlit app routes to member-owned modules. Each module should stay isolated so members can work without duplicating or overwriting each other's work.

- module-level documentation where needed
- sample inputs and outputs
- screenshots or recordings for evidence

### Week 2 Progress Tracking

Use `docs/team-roster.md` as the source for member-level progress. Use `week2/docs/Weekly/Week2_Status_Report.md` for the weekly consolidated summary.

When a member is not responding:

1. Mark the status as `No response` only after a follow-up date is known.
2. Add the first and second follow-up dates.
3. Record the exact deliverables missing.
4. Keep notes factual and professional.
